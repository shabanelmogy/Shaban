# PHASE 6: Final Reconciliation

Use this packet after every applicable focused phase. It is mandatory for a
broad feature review or implementation.

Approved references used by prior phases:



The Master Guide and canonical pattern books are authoritative. This packet is
derivative. Stop and report drift when they disagree.

## Purpose

- Prove that focused phase outputs describe one coherent feature.
- Detect end-to-end failures that no isolated phase owns completely.
- Review the complete scoped diff and report verification honestly.

## Included concerns

- All applicable phase artifacts.
- Final source contracts and scoped diff.
- Evidence coverage and unresolved requirements.
- Frontend/backend consistency.
- Route, provider, action, refresh, upload, and error paths.
- Continuous quality gates.
- Migration, compatibility, compile/runtime risk, and owner verification.

## Explicit exclusions

- New unrelated refactors.
- Implementing Uncertain requirements.
- Accepting a phase-local result without cross-phase comparison.
- Claiming build, browser, runtime, or database verification that did not occur.

## Dependencies and input gate

Required:

- Phase 0 manifest and evidence register.
- Every applicable phase output.
- Final scoped source state.
- Known pre-existing user changes.

A changed upstream contract marks affected downstream artifacts stale. Reconcile
or rerun them before completion.

## Mandatory comparisons

1. Screenshot evidence ↔ implemented functional behavior.
2. Grid columns/action needs ↔ frontend list model ↔ backend ListVM.
3. Filter controls ↔ query keys ↔ backend exact lookup keys.
4. Page request ↔ total count ↔ response metadata ↔ pager state.
5. View fields ↔ Detail DTO.
6. Form controls ↔ Add/Update DTOs ↔ server ownership.
7. Save ↔ validation ↔ persistence/transaction ↔ close and refresh.
8. Actions ↔ backend authorization/state ↔ confirmation/input ↔ recovery.
9. Service failures ↔ component handling for both failure channels.
10. Routes/modes ↔ editor shape and dirty exit.
11. Upload UI ↔ storage and cleanup contract.
12. Translation keys ↔ English and Arabic.
13. Styles ↔ local ownership, accessibility, RTL, theme, and responsive rules.
14. Providers ↔ interceptor-enabled `HttpClient` and authentication path.

## Required outputs

### Reconciliation table

| Contract/path | Producer artifact | Consumer artifact | Final source evidence | Status | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

### Scoped source review

Confirm:

- complete scoped diff reviewed;
- stale imports and types checked;
- routes and providers checked;
- translations checked;
- mappings and server-owned payload fields checked;
- merge markers and whitespace checked;
- unrelated user changes preserved;
- reference modules unchanged unless explicitly scoped.

### Final report

Report:

- files changed;
- phases applied and skipped with reasons;
- decisions and evidence;
- frontend, backend, contract, mapping, and calculation changes;
- action and refresh behavior;
- Missing, Conflicting, and Uncertain requirements;
- migration requirement;
- possible compile/runtime risks;
- verification performed and pending;
- owner manual checks;
- prohibited or owner-only commands not run.

## Completion gate

Do not report the feature complete while a Missing, Conflicting, or Uncertain
contract blocks required behavior. A clean diff check is not proof of successful
build or runtime behavior.
