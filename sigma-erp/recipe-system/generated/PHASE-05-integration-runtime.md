Approved wiring references:

- `SiGmaAngularFrontEnd/src/app/pages/routing.ts`
- `SiGmaAngularFrontEnd/src/app/app.module.ts`
- `SiGmaAngularFrontEnd/src/app/app-routing.module.ts`

Reference roles: `pages/routing.ts` owns the lazy feature entry;
`app.module.ts` owns the single interceptor-equipped root client;
`app-routing.module.ts` is the transitional AuthGuard/access reference from
UI block 26. LayoutModule is inspected as a consumer when relevant, not copied
as a feature-level HttpClient provider.

The Master Guide and canonical pattern books are authoritative. This packet is
derivative. Stop using a packet that disagrees with canonical sources. Follow
Master block 8: run recipe `-Check` before use; reconcile initial drift or changed
book/template/manifest claims, regenerate affected packets through the generator,
semantically review their source rules and approved-reference roles, then rerun
`-Check` before use or handoff. Record packet IDs and review evidence. Preserve
unrelated changes; source-read-only review still forbids application-source edits.
Use canonical sources and report a precise blocker for unresolved conflicts.

## Purpose

- Catch route, provider, interceptor, event, and async-lifecycle failures that
  local component review cannot see.
- Protect existing consumers when contracts or service identities change.

## Included concerns

- Lazy routes and route-mode data.
- Routed versus dialog editor integration.
- Standalone imports and shared module dependencies.
- Feature service registration and injector scope.
- Interceptor-enabled `HttpClient` and authentication headers.
- Shared versus feature service naming and identity.
- Dialog and toast registration.
- Translation registration.
- Parent/child events and refresh signals.
- Subscription cleanup, cancellation, and stale responses.
- Deep links, back behavior, and direct consumers of changed contracts.
- Authenticated-shell viewport sizing and single vertical-scroll ownership.

## Explicit exclusions

- Redesigning Grid or editor markup.
- Reopening frozen domain contracts without a reported conflict.
- Full-solution scans unrelated to direct consumers.

## Dependencies and input gate

Required:

- Feature Review Manifest.
- Frozen service/endpoints from Phase 1.
- Route, refresh, and event requirements from Phases 2 through 4.
- Direct consumer list for changed shared contracts.

## Procedure

1. Trace the feature from application route to lazy child route.
2. Verify mode data and component shape agree.
3. Verify every standalone import used by the template.
4. Trace each feature service to its actual injector and `HttpClient` provider.
5. Verify token and error interceptors are applied.
6. Follow UI block 1's one-root-client contract: authenticated feature services
   use `providedIn: 'root'` and the interceptor-equipped client configured once
   in AppModule. LayoutModule and feature injectors do not provide another client.
   Reject manual Bearer headers or feature-level `provideHttpClient` forks.
7. Verify each request has one active interceptor path and each mutation has one
   success-feedback owner; a feature success after a standard mutation must not
   duplicate the global interceptor toast.
8. Check service-name collisions and unintended root fallbacks.
9. Trace parent/child close, changed, save, and refresh events.
10. Verify cancellation and destruction for every subscription.
11. Check translations and overlay services are registered.
12. Inspect only direct consumers of changed models, endpoints, or shared services.
13. Verify the authenticated document is viewport-bound, every flex ancestor
    can shrink with `min-height: 0`, the route uses the container-fill host,
    and `.app-content` never scrolls: each region has one internal scroll
    owner, per block 1.

## Required outputs

### Route and mode map

| Route/dialog | Component | Mode source | Detail ID source | Exit target | Dirty protection |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

### Provider and interceptor map

| Service | Declared provider | Resolved injector | HttpClient configuration | Authorization header path | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

### Event and refresh map

| Producer | Event/result | Consumer | State changed | Refresh behavior | Cleanup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

## Continuous gates

- Feature services resolve the one interceptor-equipped root HttpClient; there
  is no LayoutModule client, manual Authorization header or feature client fork.
- One request traverses one interceptor chain, and one successful mutation emits
  one success notification.
- Routed editors and dialog editors use the route counts defined by their shape.
- All subscriptions have destruction or cancellation behavior.
- Body-appended overlays retain feature-scoped styling and correct focus.
- Direct consumers are checked before narrowing a model or renaming a service.
- Neither the browser document nor `.app-content` scrolls; tall content stays
  keyboard- and touch-scrollable inside its own component scroll owner.
- No runtime claim is made from source inspection alone.

## Expected handoff

Phase 6 receives the route, provider, interceptor, event, compatibility, and
runtime-risk artifacts.
