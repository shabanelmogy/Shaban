The Master Guide and canonical pattern books are authoritative. This packet is
derivative. Stop and report drift when they disagree.

## Purpose

- Catch route, provider, interceptor, event, and async-lifecycle failures that
  local component review cannot see.
- Protect existing consumers when contracts or service identities change.

## Included concerns

- Lazy routes and route-mode data.
- Routed versus dialog editor integration.
- Standalone imports and shared module dependencies.
- Feature service registration and injector scope.
- Interceptor-enabled `HttpClient` and authentication headers.
- Shared versus feature service naming and identity.
- Dialog and toast registration.
- Translation registration.
- Parent/child events and refresh signals.
- Subscription cleanup, cancellation, and stale responses.
- Deep links, back behavior, and direct consumers of changed contracts.
- Authenticated-shell viewport sizing and single vertical-scroll ownership.

## Explicit exclusions

- Redesigning Grid or editor markup.
- Reopening frozen domain contracts without a reported conflict.
- Full-solution scans unrelated to direct consumers.

## Dependencies and input gate

Required:

- Feature Review Manifest.
- Frozen service/endpoints from Phase 1.
- Route, refresh, and event requirements from Phases 2 through 4.
- Direct consumer list for changed shared contracts.

## Procedure

1. Trace the feature from application route to lazy child route.
2. Verify mode data and component shape agree.
3. Verify every standalone import used by the template.
4. Trace each feature service to its actual injector and `HttpClient` provider.
5. Verify token and error interceptors are applied.
6. Under the current transitional architecture, verify every authenticated
   feature service resolves from `_metronic/layout/layout.module.ts` providers,
   because that injector owns the interceptor-equipped client. Reject a manual
   Bearer header or feature-level `provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([tokenInterceptor, errorInterceptor]))`
   fork as a workaround.
7. Verify each request has one active interceptor path and each mutation has one
   success-feedback owner; a feature success after a standard mutation must not
   duplicate the global interceptor toast.
8. Check service-name collisions and unintended root fallbacks.
9. Trace parent/child close, changed, save, and refresh events.
10. Verify cancellation and destruction for every subscription.
11. Check translations and overlay services are registered.
12. Inspect only direct consumers of changed models, endpoints, or shared services.
13. Verify the authenticated document is viewport-bound, every flex ancestor
    can shrink with `min-height: 0`, the route uses the container-fill host,
    and `.app-content` never scrolls: each region has one internal scroll
    owner, per block 1.

## Required outputs

### Route and mode map

| Route/dialog | Component | Mode source | Detail ID source | Exit target | Dirty protection |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

### Provider and interceptor map

| Service | Declared provider | Resolved injector | HttpClient configuration | Authorization header path | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

### Event and refresh map

| Producer | Event/result | Consumer | State changed | Refresh behavior | Cleanup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

## Continuous gates

- A service registered only in the root injector must not accidentally bypass
  Layout interceptors.
- Until the root-client backlog is resolved, authenticated feature services are
  registered in the interceptor-owning `LayoutModule` injector; there is no
  manual Authorization-header or feature `provideHttpClient` fork.
- One request traverses one interceptor chain, and one successful mutation emits
  one success notification.
- Routed editors and dialog editors use the route counts defined by their shape.
- All subscriptions have destruction or cancellation behavior.
- Body-appended overlays retain feature-scoped styling and correct focus.
- Direct consumers are checked before narrowing a model or renaming a service.
- Neither the browser document nor `.app-content` scrolls; tall content stays
  keyboard- and touch-scrollable inside its own component scroll owner.
- No runtime claim is made from source inspection alone.

## Expected handoff

Phase 6 receives the route, provider, interceptor, event, compatibility, and
runtime-risk artifacts.
