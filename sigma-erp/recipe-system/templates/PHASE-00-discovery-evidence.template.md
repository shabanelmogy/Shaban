# PHASE 0: Discovery and Evidence

Use this packet before a broad Sigma feature review or implementation. It
establishes scope, evidence, UI/backend shapes, references, and the initial
contract map. It does not authorize source edits.

## Canonical provenance

{{SOURCE_FINGERPRINTS}}

Approved references, when a shape is already known:

{{APPROVED_REFERENCES}}

The Master Guide and canonical pattern books are authoritative. This packet is
derivative. Stop using a packet that disagrees with canonical sources. Follow
Master block 8: run recipe `-Check` before use; reconcile initial drift or changed
book/template/manifest claims, regenerate affected packets through the generator,
semantically review their source rules and approved-reference roles, then rerun
`-Check` before use or handoff. Record packet IDs and review evidence. Preserve
unrelated changes; source-read-only review still forbids application-source edits.
Use canonical sources and report a precise blocker for unresolved conflicts.

## Purpose

- Define one review boundary.
- Separate evidence from inference.
- Select one approved reference per shape.
- Expose missing or conflicting contracts before implementation.
- Produce inputs that later phase reviewers can trust.

## Included concerns

- User request, screenshots, videos, and written notes.
- Feature routes, components, services, models, endpoints, mappings, entities,
  persistence configuration, translations, and direct shared dependencies.
- List, editor, dialog, report, aggregate, and action shapes.
- Existing working-tree changes in the scoped files.
- Action inventory and known authentication/authorization mechanism.

## Explicit exclusions

- Implementing fixes.
- Choosing a component from screenshot appearance.
- Inventing fields, endpoints, permissions, or state transitions.
- Full-solution scanning or unrelated architectural review.

## Dependencies and input gate

Required inputs:

- Requested feature and outcome.
- Frozen Maintenance / Evolution Plan when the Master Guide requires one.
- All supplied evidence.
- Directly related source.
- Master Guide.

If the scope cannot be identified from those sources, record the exact missing
route, file, contract, or business decision. Do not guess.

## Procedure

1. If a Maintenance / Evolution Plan applies, import its Frozen scope, target
   contracts, impact map, implementation slices, and remaining non-blocking open
   decisions. Do not redesign the target silently in Phase 0.
2. Assign each screenshot or workflow source an Evidence ID.
3. Record known screen, mode, role, locale, direction, viewport, date/version,
   and whether it is current or historical.
4. Extract only functional and content requirements.
5. Classify every item as Explicit, Strong inference, or Uncertain.
6. Inventory direct source producers and consumers.
7. Select the simplest applicable UI shapes and backend pattern.
8. Select one approved reference per shape.
9. Create the initial column, filter, detail/write, action, and route contracts.
10. Mark every row Confirmed, Derived, Missing, Conflicting, or Uncertain.
11. Select the later phases required by the feature.

## Continuous gates

- Screenshots are never design authority.
- Absence from one screenshot is not evidence for removal.
- A visible action is not authorization evidence.
- Static screenshots provide weak state-transition evidence.
- Uncertain items are not implemented automatically.
- A required Maintenance / Evolution Plan is Frozen before implementation phases
  begin; Phase 0 reports any new evidence that would invalidate it.
- Reference modules are read-only unless explicitly scoped.

## Expected handoff

Later phases receive the manifest, relevant evidence rows, frozen upstream
contracts, unresolved requirements, and exact scoped paths. Phase 0 is complete
only when no requirement is represented as an unlabeled inference.
