## 18. Edge cases

> **Status: Canonical**

Walk this list before calling an entity finished. Mark a row not applicable
rather than skipping it silently.

### Tenant ownership

`SubscriptionId` is server-owned. `SiGmaDbContext.SaveChangesAsync` stamps it
from the authenticated claim on insert and throws `InvalidOperationException`
if an existing row's value changes. Never assign it in a service, a child loop,
or a mapping (`item.SubscriptionId = entity.SubscriptionId` is wrong), and never
accept it from a payload.

### Input

| Case | Expected |
|---|---|
| Required string `null`, `""`, or `"   "` | Rejected. `[Required]` alone does not reject whitespace — trim in the service |
| String at and over max length | Accepted at the limit, rejected above it, and the limit matches `HasMaxLength` |
| Number at min, at max, out of range | Boundaries accepted, outside rejected |
| Decimal with more scale than the column | Rounded deliberately, not truncated by chance |
| Negative amount or quantity | Rejected unless the business allows it |
| Enum sent as an undefined number | Rejected via `Enum.IsDefined`; never silently mapped to the default member |
| Nullable enum omitted | Distinct from an invalid value |
| Date `0001-01-01` or `DateTime.MinValue` | Rejected when a real date is required |
| Reversed range, `from > to` | Rejected |
| Equal boundaries, `from == to` | Explicitly allowed or rejected, documented |
| Date-only value near midnight | Calendar date preserved; no UTC conversion. See UI block 17 |
| Leap day, month end | Accepted |
| Duplicate value differing only by case or spacing | Matches the documented normalization rule |

### Records and relationships

| Case | Expected |
|---|---|
| Valid create, valid update | Succeeds |
| Update a missing id | Business failure, no disclosure |
| Update a soft-deleted row | Not found — the repository filters it |
| Update a row from another tenant | Not found, and the response does not reveal that it exists |
| Duplicate on create | Rejected |
| Duplicate on update, unchanged row | **Accepted** — the self-exclusion works |
| FK that does not exist | Rejected |
| FK that exists in another tenant | Rejected, and treated identically to not existing |
| FK that is inactive | Rejected where inactive rows are not selectable |
| Optional FK omitted vs sent as `0` | Omitted is fine; `0` is invalid, not "none" |
| Dependent pair mismatched, e.g. Role not in the given Department | Rejected |
| Self-reference, `ParentId == Id` | Rejected |
| Longer hierarchy cycle A→B→C→A | Rejected |
| Child collection omitted vs empty | Documented and different only if intended |
| Child id belonging to another parent | Rejected |
| Duplicate rows inside one child collection | Rejected or merged, per the documented rule |
| Delete with no references | Succeeds, soft delete applied |
| Delete with each blocking reference | Blocked with a message naming that blocker |
| Delete a row already soft-deleted | Idempotent or a clear failure, not an exception |

### Operational

| Case | Expected |
|---|---|
| Page 1, last page, page past the end | Empty list, not an error |
| `pageSize=0` or a huge `pageSize` | Clamped, per block 9 |
| Zero results | `IsSuccess = true` with an empty list — an empty result is not a failure |
| `TotalCount` on a partial last page | Exact, never derived from `TotalPages × PageSize` |
| Filter key with the wrong casing | Currently ignored — see block 9 trap |
| Malformed filter value | Treated as absent, never as a different filter |
| Duplicate submit of the same create | Blocked by the duplicate rule and by a unique index |
| Two concurrent updates to one row | Behaviour known and documented; last-write-wins is a decision, not an accident |
| Failure between parent save and child save | Transaction rolls both back |
| Failure after the document saves but before the voucher | Transaction rolls back the document too — pattern 15 |
| Bulk activate where some ids are missing | Whole call fails; nothing is flipped — block 12 |
| Unauthenticated request | 401 before any service code runs |
| Report reached with no subscription claim | Must not return other tenants' rows — `QueryReport` caveat, block 17 |
| Export whose second page fails | Whole export fails; no partial file |
| Upload with a wrong extension, oversized, or a spoofed MIME | Rejected server-side, not only in the client |
| Empty lookup for a dropdown | Success with an empty list — block 10 |

### The response contract

| Case | Expected |
|---|---|
| Business failure | `IsSuccess = false` with an actionable localized message |
| Not found, or another tenant's row | Same response shape; no existence disclosure |
| Unexpected exception | Logged internally; a safe message returned |
| Any failure | No stack trace, SQL, connection string, token or file path in the response |
| Partial write | Never reported as success |

**Check:** every applicable row exercised or explicitly marked not applicable ·
boundary values tested at the boundary, not near it · cross-tenant cases behave
identically to not-found · every "documented" decision is actually written down
in the feature's notes or this book.
