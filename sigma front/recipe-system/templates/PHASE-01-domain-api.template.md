# PHASE 1: Domain, Persistence, and API

Use this packet to establish authoritative server behavior before UI consumers
are finalized.

## Canonical provenance

{{SOURCE_FINGERPRINTS}}

Approved backend references:

{{APPROVED_REFERENCES}}

The Master Guide and Backend Pattern Book are authoritative. This packet is
derivative. Stop and report drift when they disagree.

## Purpose

- Freeze domain and API contracts consumed by read, write, and action paths.
- Keep server-owned state at the backend boundary.
- Identify persistence, transaction, compatibility, and migration effects.

## Included concerns

- Entity and aggregate shape.
- Entity base class and tenant behavior.
- EF configuration, indexes, required relationships, and migration impact.
- Add, Update, Detail, List, Select, and action DTO separation.
- AutoMapper direction and projection.
- Duplicate business keys, FK validation, delete blockers, and ownership checks.
- Transactions, child reconciliation, calculations, concurrency, and idempotency.
- Endpoint, request, response, paging, filtering, and error contracts.
- Upload persistence and cleanup contracts.

## Explicit exclusions

- Grid layout and row markup.
- Angular form structure.
- Screenshot-derived component selection.
- UI-only permission hiding.
- Running or editing migrations.

## Dependencies and input gate

Required:

- Phase 0 Feature Review Manifest.
- Evidence rows that require stored or returned data.
- Selected backend pattern.
- Scoped backend files and direct consumers.

Missing or Uncertain evidence does not authorize a new entity property or API.

## Procedure

1. Select the simplest backend pattern and entity base.
2. Inventory persisted fields, relationships, and inbound references.
3. Define separate List, Detail, Add, Update, Select, and action contracts.
4. Verify client-editable versus server-owned fields.
5. Verify mapping direction and remove only mappings proven unnecessary.
6. Define duplicate, FK, ownership, state, and delete validation.
7. Define transaction and child reconciliation boundaries.
8. Define filter parsing, stable paging, and response metadata.
9. Define both declared-failure and transport-failure behavior.
10. Record schema and API compatibility impact.

## Required outputs

### DTO ownership matrix

| Field | Entity | List | Detail | Add | Update | Select/action | Owner and reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | |

### Validation and invariant table

| Invariant | Add | Update | Delete/action | Persistence support | Failure contract |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

### Endpoint contract

| Operation | Method/route | Request | Response | Authorization/state rules | Transaction | Error behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | |

### Migration and compatibility decision

| Change | Entity/EF impact | Migration required | Existing consumers | Owner action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## Continuous gates

- Repository tenant and soft-delete behavior is understood before adding manual
  predicates.
- Required FK collections are validated by distinct count, not `Any`.
- Add and Update exclude server-owned values.
- Calculations remain backend/domain-owned.
- Upload paths and abandoned files have an explicit lifecycle.
- API failure responses remain actionable and typed.
- No migration or database command is run by the reviewer.

## Expected handoff

Phases 2, 3, and 4 receive frozen contract tables. Any later contract change
marks affected downstream reviews stale.
